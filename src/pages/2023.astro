		<SectionHeader>A little teaser</SectionHeader>
			<p>One of the funnest parts of Funconf was not giving too much away about the lineup and the schedule. Keeping things close to our chest is part of the surprise and delight of the show.</p>

			<p>
				There was one thing that was implictly present at all three Funconf events, and that was three individuals who trusted us and egged us on and came and spoke at all three events. We‚Äôre beyond delighted to announce that for continuity, and to pass the baton as it were, Michael Lopp, Tom Preston-Werner and Werner Vogels have all confirmed their attendance at This Next Thing.

			<SectionHeader>Why?</SectionHeader>
			<p>
				Because we believe that events like this should exist. Events, conferences, gatherings are an opportunity to learn, empower oneself and to be truly inspired, more efficiently than any other media.
			</p>
			<p>
				Further: we think events should spark serendipity. They should be full of little moments and shared experiences that create meaningful relationships.
