						The venue is the <a href="https://www.kronenhof.com/en/" class="font-bold">Grand Hotel Kronenhof</a>, <a href="https://www.kronenhof.com/en/hotel/awards/" target="_top">one of the most highly-rated hotels</a> in the world.

			<section id="why" class="tick">
				<div class="content">
					<h2>Why?</h2>
					<p>
						Because we believe that events like this should exist. Events, conferences, gatherings are an opportunity to learn, empower oneself and to be truly inspired, more efficiently than any other media.
					</p>
					<p>
						Further: we think events should spark serendipity. They should be full of little moments and shared experiences that create meaningful relationships.
