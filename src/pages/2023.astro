			<SectionHeader>Why?</SectionHeader>
			<p>
				Because we believe that events like this should exist. Events, conferences, gatherings are an opportunity to learn, empower oneself and to be truly inspired, more efficiently than any other media.
			</p>
			<p>
				Further: we think events should spark serendipity. They should be full of little moments and shared experiences that create meaningful relationships.
