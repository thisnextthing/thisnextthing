This Next Thing will gather interesting and interested people, celebrating our relationships with the world, and exploring how those relationships should evolve.

				<strong class="font-heavy uppercase text-sm text-white">Day One</strong>
				Monday, June 26 - Travel, Check-in and Chat

				Travel day. Depart your starter city not-too-early, not-too-late, for a trip with your new friends. A 3–4 hour ride first toward The Alps, and then up and up into them, towards Pontresina. Check-in to your hotel, then relax and unwind for a few hours before the evening session kicks off.

			<SectionHeader>Where?</SectionHeader>

			<SectionSubheader>June 25</SectionSubheader>
			<p>The unconference will take place in the centre of each starter city.</p>

			<SectionSubheader>June 26–28</SectionSubheader>
			<p>
				The venue is the <a href="https://www.kronenhof.com/en/" class="font-bold">Grand Hotel Kronenhof</a>, <a href="https://www.kronenhof.com/en/hotel/awards/" target="_top">one of the most highly-regarded hotels</a> in the world. Grand Hotel Kronenof is in the town of Pontresina, in the Eastern Swiss Alps.

			<SectionHeader>Why?</SectionHeader>
			<p>
				Because we believe that events like this should exist. Events, conferences, gatherings are an opportunity to learn, empower oneself and to be truly inspired, more efficiently than any other media.
			</p>
			<p>
				Further: we think events should spark serendipity. They should be full of little moments and shared experiences that create meaningful relationships.
