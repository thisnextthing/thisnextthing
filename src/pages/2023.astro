			<p>One of the funnest parts of Funconf was not giving too much away about the lineup and the schedule. Keeping things close to our chest is part of the surprise and delight of the show.</p>

			<SectionSubheader>June 26‚Äì28</SectionSubheader>

				The venue is the <a href="https://www.kronenhof.com/en/" class="font-bold">Grand Hotel Kronenhof</a>, <a href="https://www.kronenhof.com/en/hotel/awards/" target="_top">one of the most highly-regarded hotels</a> in the world.

			<SectionHeader>Why?</SectionHeader>
			<p>
				Because we believe that events like this should exist. Events, conferences, gatherings are an opportunity to learn, empower oneself and to be truly inspired, more efficiently than any other media.
			</p>
			<p>
				Further: we think events should spark serendipity. They should be full of little moments and shared experiences that create meaningful relationships.
