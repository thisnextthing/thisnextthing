        <dt>Is Switzerland a safe place to travel to?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Switzerland is one of the safest places in Europe to travel. We advise usual travel precautions, and <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Switzerland#Stay_safe">research</a>, and we advise everyone to take out requisite travel insurance since there is movement involved with the conference.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each of the starter cities will have a point person who will be introduced online before the in-person event, and will host each of the warmup events.
          </p>

          <p>
            All of the planned travel is in groups, with that point person.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once we arrive in Pontresina, everyone will have their own hotel room, and events are organised such that at any point, nobody will be more than a few minutes walk from their room.
