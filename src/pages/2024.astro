					The event happens in three parts, starting in three different places. Guests choose their starting location, where they first get to know each other in a smaller group, before travelling together into the mountains.
				</p>
				<p>
					Part two – once all three groups convene – encompasses learning, sharing, and interacting across three types of experiences. We provide opportunities to attend talks and stories by folks along the event’s overarching themes. Workshops and classes provide out-of-the-ordinary ways to mingle and interact. And most importantly, we are always cultivating spaces to discuss: informally, in facilitated chats, while completing activities together, around game-boards, and around a table sharing food and drink experiences.

					Part three — which is optional — is winding down. This is for those who choose to stick around to continue the conversations and experiences, but without any ceremony: enjoying the mountains, hiking, taking in the spa and the surroundings, and beginning the long goodbye to their new friends.

					Next year, we will be levelling up on the foundation that our first event set in 2023. Right now, you can
					<a href="/2024/book"><strong class="font-medium underline">secure a discounted early-access ticket</strong></a> to guarantee a room in the Kronenhof. Additional capacity will again be available in the nearby Hotel Saratz.
				</p>

				<p>
					We’re excited to see you again next year, and can’t wait to share some of our new ideas. If you have questions, <a href="/2024/contact">let us know</a>.
