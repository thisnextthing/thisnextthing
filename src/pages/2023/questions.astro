      <SectionSubheader>Is this just Funconf 4?</SectionSubheader>
      <p>
        No. Funconf was its own thing, of its own time. It’s the same people, but things have changed a lot in the last 10 years. We think of it as a spiritual successor, but "This Next Thing" is its own ... thing, if you will.

      <SectionSubheader>How many folks are you expecting?</SectionSubheader>
      <p>
        We’re not sure. We’re hoping for somewhere between 100 and 200.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tickets will be on sale until April 1, 2023. After that date, we will open sales of virtual-only tickets and announce our online track. This will allow us to curate the in-person event, and arrange logistics for things that take time to organise, such as booking trains, busses, and extra special welcome materials.

      <SectionSubheader>Is Switzerland a safe place to travel to?</SectionSubheader>
      <p>
        Switzerland is one of the safest places in Europe to travel. We advise usual travel precautions, and <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Switzerland#Stay_safe">research</a>, and we advise everyone to take out requisite travel insurance since there is movement involved with the conference.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each of the starter cities will have a point person who will be introduced online before the in-person event, and will host each of the warmup events.
      </p>

      <p>
        All of the planned travel is in groups, with that point person.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once we arrive in Pontresina, everyone will have their own hotel room, and events are organised such that at any point, nobody will be more than a few minutes walk from their room.

      <SectionSubheader>What’s the point of This Next Thing?</SectionSubheader>
        <p>
          When we originally set out to organise Funconf, the brief we set ourselves was to create something that wasn’t "just a bunch of talks in a conference room".
        </p>

        <p>
          Fundamentally, relationships are the most valuable—actually invaluable—things that we have as humans that define us and enrich us in ways that more tangible valuables cannot.
        </p>

        <p>
          We want an event like This Next Thing to encourage and enrich the potential for making remarkable, lasting, meaningful relationships. Elements like travelling together, meeting informally beforehand, building step-by-step up to a grand banquet, and unwinding afterwards, with lots of space in-between, emphasise that coming together is about relationships.

      <SectionSubheader>Who is it for?</SectionSubheader>
        <p>
          This Next Thing is for folks who love technology for technology’s sake, but also want to explore the humanity and artistry behind tech. We self-identify by our curiosity about the world, and our willingness to learn from each other.

      <SectionSubheader>Will you publish a schedule of talks?</SectionSubheader>
        <p>Maybe. Part of the fun of Funconf was the mystery of it all. We did somewhat overdo it back then. This time we do plan to publish a schedule of events for when you get there at the latest.</p>

      <SectionSubheader>What’s the cost breakdown?</SectionSubheader>
        <p>The cost includes two nights accommodation, two breakfasts, three dinners, two lunches, and the conference itself. It’s roughly 45% accommodation, 30% food, and the rest on programming.</p>

        <p>We care about quality, inclusive catering. Lunch on the travel day will be light and simple. All plated food options will be vegetarian, with meat options available. Dinner on the travel day will be with a small group, and the main day will be a banquet.</p>

      <SectionSubheader>Why Switzerland?</SectionSubheader>
        <p>Funconf started when Jonathan Siegel put his faith in us in 2010. Jonathan suggested hosting a comeback event in Switzerland in 2023, and we agreed.</p>

      <SectionSubheader>Why Pontresina?</SectionSubheader>
        <p>
          We didn’t want just any old venue, so we did a lot of research into some really outstanding venues throughout the country. We settled on the Grand Kronenhof Hotel because it had a wonderful balance of many of our criteria: flexible, lots of little spaces, an idiosyncratic combination of old and new spaces, children-welcome, lavish but not over-the-top, to name a few.

      <SectionSubheader>Do I need to dress up?</SectionSubheader>
        <p>
          No, but if you want to, do! As places to wear fancy clothes go, you’ll fit right in. Either way, it’s fine. Very much "you be you".
